First, when comparing the salary across the age distribution, we can see a trend where older individuals tend to make over \\$50,000 more frequently than younger individuals. This likely has to do with more experience aligning with higher paying jobs. We see a similar trend for `capital.gain`, `education.num`, and `hours.per.week`, where individuals with larger capital gains in the previous year, higher education levels attained, and who work more hours per week tend to make over \\$50,000 more frequently.\n",

    "Typically, data isn't readily formatted for direct input into machine learning models. It's crucial for a machine learning practitioner to examine each column and determine an effective method for encoding its information. Let's determine the types of features we have and come up with suitable encoding strategies for them. "

    "| Feature | Transformation | Explanation\n",
    "| --- | ----------- | ----- |\n",
    "| age | scaling with `StandardScaler` |  A numeric feature with no missing values, ranging from 17 to 90. Scaling is recommended due to its distinct range compared to other numeric features. While MinMaxScaler might be more suitable, using StandardScaler should be fine too.| \n",
    "| workclass | imputation, one-hot encoding | This is a categorical feature with some missing values, which means we first need to impute to properly handle missing value cases (ie. replacing them with the most common value in the column). Next, we apply one-hot encoding to the categorical feature so that our model can interpret it without assuming an ordinal relationship.|\n",
    "| fnlwgt | drop | We decided that this feature does not relate to the target (whether an individual's salary is over/under \\$50,000/year), as it pertains to the census sampling weight and not an intrinsic value of the individual. As a result, we are removing this feature from our dataframe so as to not introduce noise into our model. |\n",
    "| education | ordinal encoding | Education level has a natural order (ie. Elementary school --> Middle-school --> High-school --> Bachelors --> Masters --> Doctorate). Using ordinal encoding allows us to preserve this natural/hierarchical order numerically. |\n",
    "| education.num | drop | We already have the education feature, which we have performed ordinal encoding transformation on. Because education.num effectively provides the same information as our transformed education feature, it would be redundant to include it in our model again.|\n",
    "| marital.status | one-hot encoding  | Although categorical, marital status categories are not ordinal. One-hot encoding prevents imposing any artificial ordering and allows the model to treat each status separately. |\n",
    "| occupation | imputation, one-hot encoding  | This is another non-ordinal, categorical feature with missing values, which means we need to impute in order to properly handle the missing value cases. We then apply one-hot encoding to the categorical feature so that the model can interpret the data without assuming an ordinal relationship.| \n",
    "| relationship | one-hot encoding  | Similar to above, there is no order to this categorical feature, and so we want to apply one-hot encoding so as to not assume an ordered relationship.|\n",
    "| race | drop  | While race is a categorical feature, its inclusion can introduce ethical concerns (bias in our prediction). Here we are either assuming that race is not related to whether or not an individual earns over/under \\$50,000 per year, or that we do not want to look at race as a determinant of income for the sake of this analysis. And so, dropping avoids potential bias issues in the model.|\n",
    "| sex | one-hot encoding with \"binary=True\" | Biological sex is binary (Male/Female), so we can employ one-hot encoding as a single 0/1 feature instead of expanding into multiple dummy columns.|\n",
    "| capital.gain | scaling with `StandardScaler` | This column has lots of extreme outliers and a wide range (lots of individuals with $0 in capital gains and lots of people with hundreds of thousands to millions in capital gains). Because this could heavily skew our model's training, scaling brings the feature values to a numeric range that is comparable with other numeric features in the dataset.| \n",
    "| capital.loss | scaling with `StandardScaler` | Like capital.gain, this is a numeric feature with skewed distribution. Scaling improves comparability with other features. |\n",
    "| hours.per.week | scaling with `StandardScaler` | Numeric value with a moderate range (1-99). like capital gains/loss, we don't want the weighting of this feature to overpower other features, and so we apply a scaling to bring the numeric distribution to a range that is comparable with the other numeric features in the dataset.|\n",
    "| native.country | imputation, one-hot encoding | This categorical feature contains some missing values, and so we first need to apply an imputation to the rows with missing values. Next, because native country is non-ordered, we want to apply one-hot encoding so as to not assume an ordinal relationship. | "

    "1. Calling fit_transform on the test data would be problematic as it would fit the scaler on the test data. This leaks information from the test set into our model, which can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates when we score our model on the test set later on. We should instead use transform as this ensures the model does not see or learn from the test data during the training phase.\n",
    "2. The Golden Rule of machine learning states that you must never use information from the test set when training your model. Following this rule helps ensure that your scoring on your test set accurately represents how well your model would perform on unseen/real-world data sets. Violating it can give an artificially high performance during evaluation, so your classifier may appear better than it really is, but it won’t necessarily improve its ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "3. Pipelines allow for a simplified and reproducible workflow but allowing you to chain multiple preprocessing and modeling steps into a single object, making it easier for you ti fit,  transform, and predict in one step without having to repeat code. Additionally, it also helps prevent against data leakage. It ensures that transformations, like scaling or imputation, are fitted only on the training data and are correctly applied to the test data, helping ensure unbiased evaluation results.\n",
    "4. You should use ColumnTransformer() when you have different types of features that require unique preprocessing steps (ie. numerical, categorical, binary, ordinal). Instead of applying transformations separately to each group, ColumnTransformer lets you apply the right transformation to each subset of columns in a single, organized pipeline, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of mistakes."
